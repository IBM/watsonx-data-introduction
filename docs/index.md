# Introducing watsonx.data 

This IBM watsonx.data hands-on lab introduces you to several core components and capabilities of IBM watsonx.data. By completing this lab, you will gain and understanding of what the watsonx.data platform provides for users.

Specifically, you will get hands-on experience in the following areas:

* The watsonx.data web-based user interface (UI), including infrastructure management, data management, running SQL statements, and managing user access
* The Presto web interface and the Presto command line interface (CLI)
*  Creating schemas and tables
* Running queries that combine data from multiple data sources (data federation)
* Offloading tables from Db2 into watsonx.data
* Rolling back a table to a previous point in time

This lab requires that a workshop environment be provisioned for you using the IBM Technology Zone (TechZone). The image used comes pre-configured with watsonx.data Developer Edition, additional database systems including Db2 and PostgreSQL, and sample data sets.
