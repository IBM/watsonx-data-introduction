# Lab Instructions

## Lab Overview

This lab is organized into a number of sections that cover many of the highlights and key features of watsonx.data.

   * Introduction to watsonx.data
   * Watsonx.data UI Navigation
   * Infrastructure Manager
   * Data Manager
   * Query Workspace
   * Time Travel
   * Federation
   * SQL Examples

## Lab Instructions

Lab instructions may contain two types of information:

* Screen (UI) interactions 
* Text commands

When an action is required, the text will include a box with the instructions.

!!! Tip "Select the Infrastructure Icon in the watsonx.data UI"

Any text that needs to be typed into the system will be outlined in grey box. 

!!! Tip "SQL"
 
    ```
    cd /root/ibm-lh-dev/bin
    ```

A copy icon is usually found on the far right-hand side of the command box. Use this to copy the text and paste it into your dialog or command window. You can also select the text and copy it that way. Once you have copied the text, paste the value into the appropriate dialog using the paste command or menu.

!!! Note "Copy and Paste"

Some commands may span multiple lines, so make sure you copy everything in the box if you are not using the copy button
